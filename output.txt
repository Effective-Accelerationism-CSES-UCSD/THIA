I understand that you feel discouraged about your feelings during the summer months, and it's important to remember that everyone's experiences are unique. While I can't prescribe a specific diet, a balanced diet and regular exercise can help support good mental health. Including pizza in your diet is absolutely fine as long as it's part of a balanced meal plan.

In addition to a balanced diet and exercise, there are other things you can try to help manage symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD):
1. Light Therapy: Exposure to artificial light can help mimic the effects of natural sunlight and improve your mood. I recommend discussing light therapy with a healthcare professional to determine the best type and duration of light therapy for your needs.
2. Psychotherapy: Talking to a mental health professional can help you understand and cope with your feelings. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common type of therapy used to treat SAD.
3. Medication: Antidepressants such as SSRIs or bupropion can help manage symptoms of SAD. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to determine if medication is appropriate for you.
