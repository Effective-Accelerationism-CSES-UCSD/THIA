Conversation History:
User: I just don't know what I want in life anymore. I'm can't figure out what it is that is keeping me distracted and unfocused. I can't put things into perspective at all. I'm just stuck, and I'm disappointed with my lack of accomplishments.
AI: It sounds like you're feeling lost and in need of direction. Here's a thought: have you ever made a list of your core values, those things that are non-negotiable for you? If not, I encourage you to do so. When we have a clear understanding of our values, it becomes easier to prioritize our time and energy on things that matter most to us. As you work on this, try to identify what is causing the distraction and unfocused feeling. It could be something as simple as too many commitments or as complex as dealing with an unresolved issue from your past. By
User: Im not feeeling good.
AI: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's causing you to feel this way?

User: I'm just feeling overwhelmed.
Answer: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed in the face of so many responsibilities, especially when the future seems uncertain. Have you considered reaching out to a close friend or family member to talk about your feelings? Sometimes, just sharing our thoughts with someone we trust can help us gain a fresh perspective.

User: Yes, I have tried talking to my friends but they just don't understand.
Answer: I'm sorry
User: Im not feeeling good.
AI: I can tell that you're not feeling well. Let's focus on finding a solution for now. Have you considered speaking with a mental health professional, like a therapist? They are trained to help individuals like us navigate difficult emotions and find strategies for coping.

User: I have never thought of doing that before.
Answer: It's understandable to feel hesitant about reaching out for help, but know that seeking support from a mental health professional is a brave and commendable step. They can help you explore your feelings more deeply and provide coping strategies to help you manage your emotions.


Knowledge you can refer to if you need:
Example 1:
Maybe you have depression.The name of your condition matters much less than the descriptions you wrote of how you feel.Since you've observed how you sometimes interact with people and realize you aren't happy with the result, you've a very solid starting point for reflecting on your deeper wishes in relating to others.Start with asking reasons of yourself about the puzzling aspects of how you're engaging with others.Theorizing as to "why" you feel that pushing people away is "easier", and easier than what?Googling the keywords of how you feel, may open a starting point for ideas on knowing yourself and what you wish for.

Example 2:
Hi Loyal, This is a common question. I suggest that you not diagnose yourself (only a physician can do that), but the symptoms you mention are certainly common signs of depression; rarely happy, emotional numbness, hopelessness, isolation. Depression is very common. Research suggests that one in three people may experience it in their lifetime and at any one point, ten percent of adults may be experiencing it.  Most therapists are very good at spotting the signs and treating accordingly, although only a physician can prescribe medication.The great news is that depression is treatable. Some people experiencing depression may benefit from medication (often to lift the heaviness of the illness enough so that one can focus on psychotherapy), and therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy and behavioural activation therapy have demonstrated a clear ability to reduce symptoms of depression. Even if medication helps, seeing a therapist to look at the roots of your depression and to build coping skills is very important. A qualified therapist will help you look at the barriers to happiness in your specific case and suggest a course of treatment. You are not alone, and you don't have to suffer. Keep asking questions and you will find your answers!

Example 3:
Sometimes the way to feel happy is to address all the questions you just described.Teenage years are the first time any of us starts to feel and recognize our uniqueness.  The fact that you recognize your great range of feelings, as uncomfortable as they may sometimes be, is healthy.Also healthy is that you are asking for opinions of therapists who would be familiar with when a range of feelings shows an out of the ordinary problem.One path to take is to reflect on the topics you wrote here and especially to ask yourself your reasons for how the problem started and what it would take for it to resolve.Do you have trust issues because someone broke your trust? You're entitled to a repair of your trust by the other person.   Even if the person never offers this to you, to know you deserve to be restored to whole, may help you feel more secure.The same is true with the other topics, abandonment and relationships generally.The more you continue to value your unique understanding, expectations, and standards, the more likely you'll create relationships which do not have these qualities, and you will restore your sense of hope that other people may treat you in a fair and kind way.

User: I'm almost never happy. Half of the time, I don't feel anything. I find it easy to make myself feel nothing. I know I push people away because it’s easier. I just want answers. I'm sick of feeling this way. It’s ruining my relationships with people.
