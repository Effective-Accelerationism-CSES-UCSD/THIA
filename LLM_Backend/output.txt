It sounds like you may be feeling overwhelmed and lost. Have you considered making a list of what brings you joy and fulfillment? Or, perhaps reflecting on the things you love about yourself and/or what others love about you? It could be helpful to take a step back and focus on the basics, like self-care and reconnecting with yourself. When you have a better understanding of what brings you happiness and fulfillment, it may become easier to focus and put things into perspective. Additionally, it could be helpful to speak with a mental health professional for additional support and guidance.
